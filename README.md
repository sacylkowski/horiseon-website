In the HTML code, many <div> elements are replaced with either <section>, <nav>, <article>, <header>, and <footer> elements to reduce confusion.  As well as adding comments in between sections.  

Links to sections are all working (./assets/images/Screen-shot.png).

Some <div> elements received the same class as the CSS code was all the same for many of them.  

CSS code was consolidated and comments were added to help find elements faster.
